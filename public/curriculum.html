The environment is prepared keeping in mind the needs of the toddlers and to foster independence, psychomotor development, language development and understanding of the world around them. Learning takes place through exploration, observation, interaction and experience.</h4>
                  <h4>We have XSEED as our curriculum partner in our endeavour to inculcate the joy of learning in our children. The HOTS-driven learning process involves the 5 As – Aim, Action/Activity, Analysis/Discussion, Application, and Assessment. This integrated curriculum follows the natural pattern of learning of each child and is divided in to Language, Math, Theme (World Around Them), Self-Awareness & Care, Play for Fine & Gross Motor Skill Development, Movement, Art & Music.</h4>
                  <h4>Language is presented through songs, stories, phonic lessons, and conversations. The teachers establish a close and nurturing bond with each child to develop trust and security. The preschool assemblies, project presentations, circle time, show and tell, thematic celebrations, festivals, etc., are all aimed at enhancing pronunciation and clarity of speech. Developing skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing is the prime focus.  Field trips, nature walks, sand play, working outdoors, are some of the opportunities that are provided to enhance their understanding of the world around them. </h4>
                  <h4>All the above-mentioned categories are linked to each other and integrated with life skills and value education modules to make children independent and self-reliant.

Apart from the subjects offered, children are engaged in various co-curricular activities like, swimming, skating, PE, dance, yoga, art, music, chess, martial arts, etc.</h4>
                  <h4><b>Language development</b> is at its peak in this age group and the curriculum is designed to provide a rich learning opportunity to the child through – introduction of new languages (Hindi and Kannada); music; stories; vocabulary enrichment; DEAR (Drop Everything And Read); focus on spoken language through classroom discussions; circle time; elocution; project presentation; poem recitation; exposure to various forms and media; developing listening, speaking, reading and writing skills; careful planning of activities and resources according to the needs of each child. </h4>
                  <h4><b>Math</b> curriculum is planned keeping in mind its predominance in our lives in some form or the other. Concepts are introduced through stories and real-life situations; activities and resources are planned to engage all their senses to aid easy absorption of concepts and generalization in their daily lives; children learn to represent, compare, and use different operations with ease; preparation of portfolios and learning charts aid in better understanding and presentation of their learnings. </h4>
                  <h4><b>EVS</b> concepts are introduced through stories, experiences, and materials.

It enables children to become self-directed learners who work together and conduct in-depth investigations on real-life topics that intrigue them.  All the subject areas, like, language, math, science, history, geography, art, music, movement, computers, etc., are integrated in PBL. It culminates into an Annual Project Presentation which is a celebration of learning. Our children present their learning journey to their parents and peers. Teachers feel that PBL accommodates students with varying learning styles. It also acts as a reliable assessment tool for the teachers to know more about the child, his/her capabilities and skills, and address a range of issues in a more meaningful way. </h4>

Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, and Statistics are integrated in order to equip the child to understand the various mathematical relations, techniques, principles and functions.</h4>
                  <h4><b>Science</b> Curriculum is divided in to Physics, Chemistry and Biology streams. Concepts are presented through activities involving varied materials, discussions, experiences, experiments, and projects. Field trips, forms of media and expert interaction are some opportunities provided to enhance their conceptual understanding and take them beyond the curriculum. </h4>
                  <h4><b>Social Sciences</b> Curriculum is divided in to History, Geography, and Civics. Children gain exposure to the world around them.

Our mentors are experts from different professional backgrounds who have volunteered to guide our students through their projects with their valuable inputs.  Children maintain a journal of their project. They present their final products and share their experiences at the end of the academic session. Guest lectures / workshops are organized during the ACE program where successful professionals from different walks of life share their experiences with our children giving them a sneak peek in to their lives and professions. </h4>
